Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. I want to visit because of
its unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures, bustling street markets, and iconic skyline.
I would love to explore Victoria Peak and sample delicious dim sum. Plus Hongkong has Disneyland, the most magical place on earth.
