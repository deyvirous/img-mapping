New York is a major city in the United States. I want to visit because of
its iconic landmarks, diverse culture, and bustling energy.
I would love to see the Statue of Liberty and explore Central Park.
New York is also the place where some popular media came to life such as Spider-man, FRIENDS, and Hamilton.
